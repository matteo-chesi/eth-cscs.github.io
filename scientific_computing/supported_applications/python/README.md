# List of supported Python modules 

* Available on all Python installations (module called "Python", with capital P)

## Notes on the Python modules built with EasyBuild 

* The current set up contains basic modules on the main Python easyconfig file 
* Special modules come as separated easyconfig files 
  * and once installed, they appear as a loadable module.

---

## Built-in modules

* Can be imported after loading the Python module    
  * Setuptools 
  * Pip
  * Nose 
  * Numpy 
  * Scipy 
  * mpi4py 
  * Cython  
  * Six  
  * Virtualenv 
  * pandas  

## Loadable modules

* Need an extra module load before the 'import'
  * h5py (serial/parallel) 
  * matplotlib 
  * pyCuda  (daint-gpu only)
  * netcdf4

# Python Virtual Environment

If you wish to install your own python modules, we recommend you to use [virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) 

Start by loading Python, e.g., with Python 2.7

```
module load Python/2.7.12-CrayGNU-2016.11
```

## Setup your virtual environment

To create a virtual environment into which your modules will be installed,
you should use the provided `virtualenv` tool:

```
mkdir venv-2.7
virtualenv --system-site-packages venv-2.7
```

The following list of folders should be created inside the folder `venv-2.7`
```
bin include lib lib64
```

---

## Activate the Python Virtual Environment

In order to activate the python environment
```
source venv-2.7/bin/activate
```

which should replace the python with the one provided by the virtual environment
```
which python
$USER/venv-2.7/bin/python
```

One can use the following options to control the access to system installed packages

* The option `--system-site-packages` gives the virtual environment access to all modules already installed in the system (e.g numpy, pycuda, ...)
* If you would like to create a completely isolated virtual environment, you should use the ``--no-site-packages`` option instead.

## Deactivate the Python Virtual Environment

In the terminal just

```
deactivate
```
